      "question": "The electric charge or electrode deposition of one gram equivalent of a substance is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "One ampere for one second",
        "b": "One ampere for one hour",
        "c": "Charge on one mole of electrons",
        "d": "96,500 coulombs per second"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too small. This is only 1 Coulomb.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Not equivalent to one Faraday.",
        "c": "Correct. One mole of electrons equals 96,500 C. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_constant'>See here</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect unit. Itâ€™s 96,500 Coulombs total, not per second."

      "question": "What happens to the oxidizing agent in an oxidation-reduction reaction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is reduced as it gains electrons",
        "b": "It is oxidized as it gains electrons",
        "c": "It is reduced as it loses electrons",
        "d": "It is oxidized as it loses electrons"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Oxidizing agents gain electrons and are reduced. <a href='https://www.chemguide.co.uk/redox/definitions.html'>More info</a>",
        "b": "Gaining electrons is reduction, not oxidation.",
        "c": "Losing electrons is oxidation, not reduction.",
        "d": "This is true for reducing agents, not oxidizing agents."

      "question": "Which of the following is true for an electrolytic cell?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Electrons flow towards the anode",
        "b": "Electrons flow through the salt bridge",
        "c": "An electric current is produced by a chemical reaction",
        "d": "A nonspontaneous reaction is forced to occur"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Electrons actually flow toward the cathode.",
        "b": "Salt bridge allows ion flow, not electrons.",
        "c": "This is true for galvanic cells, not electrolytic cells.",
        "d": "Correct. Electrolytic cells drive nonspontaneous reactions using electricity. <a href='https://byjus.com/chemistry/electrolytic-cell/'>Learn more</a>"
