        "a": "atomic number of the anion",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Faraday's laws do not relate to atomic number but to the amount of substance deposited.",
        "b": "Atomic number isn't used directly in Faraday’s law.",
        "c": "Speed of cation does not determine quantity deposited.",
        "d": "Correct. Faraday’s laws relate to the equivalent weight. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_laws_of_electrolysis'>Learn more</a>"
